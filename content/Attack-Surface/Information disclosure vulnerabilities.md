### What is information disclosure?

- unintentionally revealing sensitive information to users.
- leaked type of information:
	- usernames, or financial information. 
	- sensitive commercial or business data.
	- technical details about the website and its infrastructure.

### Examples of information disclosure

- Revealing the names of hidden directories, their structure, and their contents via a `robots.txt` file or directory listing
- Providing access to source code files via temporary backups
- Explicitly mentioning database table or column names in error messages
- Unnecessarily exposing highly sensitive information, such as credit card details
- Hard-coding API keys, IP addresses, database credentials, and so on in the source code
- Hinting at the existence or absence of resources, usernames, and so on via subtle differences in application behavior

### How do information disclosure vulnerabilities arise?

- **Failure to remove internal content from public content**.For example, developer comments in markup are sometimes visible to users in the production environment.
- **Insecure configuration of the website and related technologies**. For example, failing to disable debugging and diagnostic features can sometimes provide attackers with useful tools to help them obtain sensitive information. Default configurations can also leave websites vulnerable, for example, by displaying overly verbose error messages.
- **Flawed design and behavior of the application**. For example, if a website returns distinct responses when different error states occur, this can also allow attackers to [enumerate sensitive data](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/password-based#username-enumeration), such as valid user credentials.
