title: "Shodan, Censys & FOFA"
---

Three organisations have spent years scanning every routable IP on the internet, recording banners, parsing TLS certificates, and indexing what they found. Their databases are a recon shortcut that no amount of active scanning can replicate cheaply. The question isn't whether to use them  -  it's knowing the right query syntax and which engine answers which question fastest.

## Shodan

Shodan is the oldest and most widely known internet scan database. Its query syntax is compact and its data includes banner grabs, HTTP responses, favicons, and TLS cert metadata.

### Core Query Syntax

# Everything in an org's netblock
org:"Target Inc"
 
# All hosts serving a cert with target.com in the SAN
ssl:"target.com"
 
# Specific product version  -  good for finding unpatched instances
product:"Apache httpd" version:"2.4.49"
 
# HTTP title match  -  catches admin panels and internal tools
http.title:"Admin Panel"
http.title:"Jenkins"
http.title:"Kibana"
http.title:"Grafana"
 
# Combine them
org:"Target Inc" http.title:"Admin"
ssl:"target.com" product:"nginx" port:8443
Favicon Hash Dorks
Favicons rarely change between environments. If you hash the production favicon, you can find every host serving the same app  -  including staging instances with no DNS record.

**Computing the hash:**

import mmh3
import requests
import base64
 
def favicon_hash(url):
    r = requests.get(url, timeout=10)
    favicon = base64.encodebytes(r.content)
    return mmh3.hash(favicon)
 
# Usage
hash_val = favicon_hash("https://target.com/favicon.ico")
print(f"http.favicon.hash:{hash_val}")
# http.favicon.hash:-1234567890
# Install dependencies
pip install mmh3 requests
 
# Then search Shodan
shodan search 'http.favicon.hash:-1234567890' --fields ip_str,port,org
 
# Common hashes for known panels  -  worth checking on every target
# Jupyter Notebook: http.favicon.hash:1335394149
# phpMyAdmin:       http.favicon.hash:1531044888
# Grafana:          http.favicon.hash:-939714854
Shodan CLI
# Install
pip install shodan
 
# Set API key
shodan init YOUR_API_KEY
 
# Search and output as JSON
shodan search --fields ip_str,port,org,product 'org:"Target Inc"' > shodan_results.json
 
# Count results before downloading
shodan count 'ssl:"target.com"'
 
# Get all info about a specific IP
shodan host 203.0.113.42
 
# Download full result set (uses credits)
shodan download target_results 'org:"Target Inc"'
shodan parse --fields ip_str,port,product target_results.json.gz
High-Value Shodan Dorks
# Exposed internal services
org:"Target Inc" port:27017              # MongoDB
org:"Target Inc" port:9200 product:"Elastic"  # Elasticsearch
org:"Target Inc" port:6379 product:"Redis"
org:"Target Inc" port:5432 product:"PostgreSQL"
 
# Development environments
org:"Target Inc" http.title:"staging"
org:"Target Inc" ssl.cert.subject.cn:"*.staging.target.com"
 
# Cloud metadata  -  exposed instances with interesting banners
org:"Target Inc" http.html:"X-Amz-Request-Id"
 
# Default credentials / login pages
org:"Target Inc" http.html:"admin" http.status:200

Censys
Censys runs its own scan infrastructure and indexes differently from Shodan. Its certificate data is richer, and the query language (Censys Query Language) is more structured.

### Censys Query Syntax

# Requires API key or web UI
# Install CLI
pip install censys
 
# Hosts with target.com in TLS cert
censys search 'services.tls.certificates.leaf_data.names: target.com' --index hosts
 
# Services on a specific port with banner match
censys search 'services.port=9200 and services.service_name=ELASTICSEARCH' --index hosts
 
# Filter by autonomous system
censys search 'autonomous_system.name="TARGET INC"' --index hosts
 
# Full text search across HTTP responses
censys search 'services.http.response.body="target.com" and services.port=443' --index hosts
# CLI usage
censys view --index hosts 203.0.113.42
censys search 'services.tls.certificates.leaf_data.subject.organization="Target Inc"' \
  --index hosts --pages 5 | jq -r '.ip' | sort -u > censys_ips.txt

FOFA
FOFA is a Chinese internet scan engine operated by Baimaohui. Its data coverage skews heavily towards Asia-Pacific infrastructure  -  when a target operates in China, Japan, Korea, or Southeast Asia, FOFA often surfaces hosts that Shodan and Censys miss entirely.

### FOFA Query Syntax

# Basic domain search  -  finds hosts serving the domain in any context
domain="target.com"
 
# Body content match
body="target.com" && title="login"
body="Powered by Target Inc"
 
# Header search
header="X-Target-Version"
header="Server: Target-Custom/1.2"
 
# Certificate
cert="target.com"
cert.subject="Target Inc"
 
# IP range
ip="203.0.113.0/24"
 
# Combine  -  FOFA uses && and ||
domain="target.com" && country="CN"
cert="target.com" && port="8443"
# FOFA API  -  returns base64-encoded results
API_KEY="your_fofa_key"
EMAIL="your@email.com"
QUERY=$(echo -n 'domain="target.com"' | base64)
 
curl -s "https://fofa.info/api/v1/search/all?email=${EMAIL}&key=${API_KEY}&qbase64=${QUERY}&fields=ip,port,host,title,country&size=1000" | \
  jq -r '.results[] | @tsv'
When to Use FOFA

Target has operations in China, Japan, or South-East Asia
Shodan shows sparse results for a large org  -  FOFA may have different scan timing
Looking for Asia-Pacific CDN or hosting providers
Searching for Chinese-language admin panels on international targets


ZoomEye
ZoomEye is another Chinese internet scan engine. Narrower feature set than FOFA but worth a quick check.

# Web-only: zoomeye.org
# Query syntax similar to Shodan
# app:"nginx" +site:target.com
# service:"http" +site:target.com +country:"CN"

Practical Tips
**Don't trust rate limits.** Free Shodan searches return 100 results max. If `shodan count` shows 2,400 results, you need API credits or a creative narrowing strategy.

**Export and diff.** Run these searches at the start of a target and again two weeks later. New hosts appearing in Shodan often mean a new deployment  -  and those deployments are frequently the ones with misconfigurations from a rushed launch.

**Cross-reference with ASN data.** If your [ASN Mapping](https://bugbounty.info/../Recon/ASN-Mapping) work found three CIDRs, restrict your Shodan/Censys queries to those ranges to cut noise significantly.
