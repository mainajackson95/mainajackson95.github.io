title: "Target Selection"
---

The single biggest factor in whether you find bugs isn't your skill level. It's your target.

A great hunter on a hardened target with 200 active researchers finds nothing. An average hunter on a fresh program with a wide scope and messy codebase finds a P1 in their first session. That's not luck, that's selection.

## The Target Selection Matrix

You want to be in that top-left quadrant as much as possible. New programs with decent payouts and wide scope. The window closes fast though. Within a few weeks every recon bro with an automated pipeline has already grabbed the low-hanging fruit. But those first few weeks are gold.

## Signals of a Good Target

**Wide scope.** *.example.com is infinitely better than "only test app.example.com/dashboard." Wide scope means more attack surface, more forgotten assets, more interesting chains across subdomains.

**Complex application.** SaaS products with user roles, payment flows, file uploads, integrations, API endpoints. More features means more places things break. A brochure site with a contact form isn't worth your time.

**Active development.** Check their changelog, blog, or GitHub. Frequent deploys mean new code, new features, new bugs. Stale apps have already been picked over.

**Reasonable response times.** Check platform stats. Programs where average first response is 30+ days will drain your motivation. You want feedback loops.

**No weasel clauses.** Read the policy. Some programs have language that lets them acknowledge your bug and pay nothing. Walk away.

## Signals to Avoid

**Tiny scope with high payouts.** If the scope is a single endpoint and the bounty table goes up to $50k, they're either confident it's hardened or they'll find a reason to downgrade your findings. Either way, poor ROI.

**500+ resolved reports and 50+ active hackers.** The obvious stuff is gone. You can still find things but you'll spend 10x the time for findings that are more likely to be duped.

**Shady duplicate handling.** Check the reviews on the platform. Researchers talk. If three different people mention dodgy duplicate handling, believe them.

## My Approach

I keep a rotation of 3-5 active targets at any time. When I sit down to hunt I pick based on energy level:

- **High focus day** - Deep dive on a complex target. Business logic, auth flows, chain development.
- **Medium focus** - New recon on a target I haven't mapped yet. Content discovery, JS analysis.
- **Low energy** - Run automation against my target list, review nuclei output, check for new subdomains.

This keeps things from getting stale. If I'm stuck on one target I switch to another. Come back in a week with fresh eyes and you'll often see things you missed.

## First Blood Strategy

New programs are gold. Here's my first 48 hours:

- **Immediately** - read the full scope doc, understand the product, sign up for an account
- **Hour 1-2** - subdomain enumeration, port scan top ports, screenshot everything with gowitness
- **Hour 2-4** - tech stack profiling, identify interesting assets, deprioritize static content
- **Hour 4-8** - deep dive on the most promising 2-3 assets, focus on auth and IDOR first
- **Day 2** - JS analysis on the main app, API endpoint discovery, parameter fuzzing

The goal is a valid submission within 48 hours. Doesn't have to be critical. An early valid report establishes you on the program, gives you signal/reputation, and usually means faster triage on subsequent reports.
