# Port Scanning

Everyone defaults to the top 1000 ports and calls it done. You'll miss a lot that way. The Jenkins instance running on 8080, the Kubernetes dashboard on 10250, the Elasticsearch cluster on 9200 - all of these pay out regularly and all of them are off the default nmap port range.

---

## The Strategy: Masscan First, Nmap Second

Masscan is fast - 10M packets/second fast. It doesn't do service detection worth anything, but it can scan all 65535 ports on a /24 in minutes. Nmap is accurate, fingerprints services properly, and runs scripts - but it's slow at scale. Use them together.

---

## Step 1: Masscan - All Ports, Fast

`# Scan a single host, all portsmasscan -p1-65535 1.2.3.4 --rate=10000 -oG masscan_output.txt # Scan a range from a filemasscan -p1-65535 -iL ip_list.txt --rate=10000 \  --exclude 255.255.255.255 \  -oG masscan_results.gnmap # Parse the open ports outgrep "Ports:" masscan_results.gnmap | \  awk '{print $2, $5}' | \  sed 's|/open.*||' > open_ports.txt`

Rate tuning - don't smash it at max on a program unless the scope explicitly allows aggressive scanning. 5000-10000 is a safe middle ground.

---

## Step 2: Nmap - Service Fingerprinting on Open Ports

Take the ports masscan found and throw them at nmap for proper identification.

`# Parse masscan output and build nmap inputgrep open masscan_results.gnmap | awk '{print $2}' | sort -u > live_hosts.txtgrep open masscan_results.gnmap | grep -oP '\d+/open' | \  grep -oP '^\d+' | sort -un | tr '\n' ',' | sed 's/,$//' > open_ports_list.txt # Run nmap only on discovered open portsnmap -sV -sC -p $(cat open_ports_list.txt) \  -iL live_hosts.txt \  --open -T4 \  -oA nmap_services # Or per-host (cleaner output, slower)while IFS=: read host ports; do  nmap -sV -sC -p $ports --open -T4 $host -oN "nmap_$host.txt"done < host_ports_mapping.txt`

## Non-Standard Ports That Pay Out

These are the ports worth paying attention to when they show up open.

|Port|Service|Why It Matters|
|---|---|---|
|8080, 8443, 8888|Alt HTTP/HTTPS|Admin panels, dev servers, proxies|
|9200, 9300|Elasticsearch|Unauthenticated data access|
|27017|MongoDB|Unauthenticated access common|
|6379|Redis|Often open with no auth|
|5601|Kibana|Full log access|
|2375, 2376|Docker API|RCE via exposed daemon|
|10250|Kubernetes API (kubelet)|Node-level RCE|
|4848|GlassFish admin|Weak default creds|
|8161|ActiveMQ|Default admin/admin|
|9090|Prometheus/Cockpit|Metrics exposure, auth bypass|
|3000|Grafana, dev apps|Default creds, old vulns|
|5000|Flask dev server, Docker registry|Dev exposure|
|11211|Memcached|Unauthenticated cache dump|

`# Quick check  -  anything interesting on common non-standard ports?nmap -p 8080,8443,9200,27017,6379,5601,2375,10250,3000,5000 \  -sV --open -iL live_hosts.txt -oG interesting_ports.gnmap`

## HTTP Service Discovery from Scan Results

Once you have services fingerprinted, pipe everything that's HTTP/HTTPS into httpx.

`# Extract anything that looks like a web servicegrep -E "(http|https|nginx|apache|iis)" nmap_services.gnmap | \  awk '{print $2}' > potential_web.txt # Or use nmap's XML output more cleanlypython3 -c "import xml.etree.ElementTree as ETtree = ET.parse('nmap_services.xml')for host in tree.findall('.//host'):    addr = host.find('.//address').get('addr')    for port in host.findall('.//port'):        if port.find('state').get('state') == 'open':            portid = port.get('portid')            service = port.find('service')            if service is not None and 'http' in service.get('name',''):                print(f'{addr}:{portid}')" > http_services.txt httpx -l http_services.txt -silent -title -status-code -tech-detect`
